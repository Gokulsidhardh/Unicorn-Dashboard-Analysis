# Unicorn-Dashboard-Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of unicorn companies worldwide, focusing on their distribution, valuation, and growth across different countries and industries. The dataset, 'List of Unicorns in the World.csv', includes details like company names, countries, industries, valuations, and the dates they achieved unicorn status. The analysis involves cleaning and transforming the data, extracting key insights, and visualizing valuation trends over time using Plotly Express. The goal is to uncover patterns and trends in the unicorn ecosystem, providing valuable insights for stakeholders and researchers.
